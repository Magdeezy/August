<h1> It's Nice to Meet You, My name is Magda Perez </h1>

<p> With more than 12 years of experience in the tech industry, I am a seasoned Customer Success Manager specializing in enterprise and commercial account management. My expertise lies in driving customer engagement, expanding clients' foot print, fostering cross-team collaboration, and ensuring high customer retention. My mission is to deliver exceptional value by deeply understanding my customers' needs, goals, and challenges, and providing them with strategic solutions and dedicated support.</p>

<p> I distinguish myself as a Customer Success Manager who leads with deep empapthy for my clients driven by a startup mentality and sharp strategic insight into their needs. I believe the key to a successful client/CSM relationship must involve a unique blend of thorough research, attentive listening, and a constant curiosity to anticipate and consistently deliver positive outcomes for clients.

In my downtime, I enjoy painting, yoga, kayaking, and live music. I love traveling to see my favorite bands perform, and am always game for a local show. I love spending quality time with my husband, friends, family, and our two fur kidsâ€”a playful Pomsky named Cleo and a sassy black cat named Maya.</p>
